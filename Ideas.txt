SSIM for image quality
focus core MTF 
ability to recover a frequency 
focus core matrix
aliasing, downsampling kills high frequency
progressive training 2x and 4x
vgg on last layer required only
Post processing. Sharpening. on both downsampled vs upsampled
hyperparameter tuning, open source 
quantisation and model tuning to reduce size of model, pruning.
